# Permission Levels
[Permission Levels](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/permission-levels) is a mod made to help control ops and what they can do.  

The idea is that the server operator can now assign permission levels between 1 and 4 to a player.
This level determines what the player is a allowed to access, this could also include modded commands.  
The levels and what they generally allow can be seen on  [Mincraft gamepedia - Commands/op](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands/op#Levels).
